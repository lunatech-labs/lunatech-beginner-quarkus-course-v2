## Exercise: Initial State

In this exercise, we will be exploring Quarkus.

Let's have a look at the existing code...

* This repository contains the start of the student app.
* Import the application in your IDE
* Run the application by execusting `./mvnw quarkus:dev` in the
  folder `code` in the project.
* Browse to http://localhost:8080/q/dev-ui. What do you see?

Now that we have taken our first step in Quarkus, let's
move to the next exercise by executing
`cmtc next-exercise <path to course root folder>`
